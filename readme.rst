Hallowing Snake
***************

This is a very simple game for Adafruit's Hallowing M0 Express board,
demonstrating use of the new ``displayio`` mode from CircuitPython 4.0.

To play, you have to make sure you have flashed at least version 4.0 beta 5
of the CircuitPython firmware. Then just copy the ``main.py`` file over to
the CIRCUITPY drive, and enjoy. Touch the teeth to steer the snake, and try
to eat as many apples as you can without biting yourself.
